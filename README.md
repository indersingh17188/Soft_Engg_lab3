# Soft_Engg_lab3
Laboratory no 3 for Software Engineering MSCV 2018-2020
This lab was designed for an introduction on multidimensional arrays using pointers, pointer arithmetics, dynamic and static allocation etc.

1 Pointers as arrays
1. Declare then implement a function DisplayPointerIn f o(. . .) which displays on screen the address of the first element
of an array represented by a pointer, then all the values, if multiple, of this array.
2. To test this function, declare two integer pointers a and b to dynamically allocate arrays of integers for n elements (n
should be asked to the user). Array a will be filled with even numbers, and array b will be filled with odd numbers.

2 Swapping values of arrays represented by pointers
1. Declare the implement a function swap1(. . .) that swaps two variables represented by pointers.
2. Declare then implement a function SwapArray(. . .) that swaps all the values of two arrays represented by pointers.
Use Exercice 1 to display the results.

3 Allocation and deallocation of monodimensional and bidimensional arrays
represented by pointers
1. Declare then implement a function CreateArray(. . .) that returns a pointer to an array of n integers.
2. Declare then implement a function DeleteArray(. . .) that takes and deletes an array of integers.
3. Declare then implement a function CreateMatrix(. . .) that returns a pointer to an array of arrays of n√óm floats.
4. Declare then implement a function Deletematrix(. . .) that takes and deletes this kind of matrix.
5. Declare then implement a function DisplayMatrix(. . .) that displays the address of the matrix of floats in the memory
and all its elements.
In the main procedure, try the following: create an array or a matrix then display it immediatly. What do you remark?

4 A little bit of geometry
Declare and implement functions to compute the dot product (in 3D at least, nD suggested) and the inner product (in 3D).

5 Matrix multiplication in the general case
Declare and implement a function MatrixProduct(. . .) that returns the matricial product of two matrices of arbitraty
dimensions. What are the differences with the exercice with static arrays?

6 Pointers arithmetic
You may have used indexes and the offset operator in the previous exercices. Redo them, WITHOUT using indexes and
offset operator [] (when possible).
